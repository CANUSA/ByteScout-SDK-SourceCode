This example demonstrates creation of PDF document from the HTML template and the template data in JSON form.  
Since modern browsers prohibits loading of local files, we hosted the template on our site and use it as the link.  
Feel free to modify the template in the file "invoice_template.html" and host it on your own web resource.
Templates should conform to Handlebars templating language ( http://handlebarsjs.com/ ).
